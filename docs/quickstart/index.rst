.. _MetalK8s: https://github.com/scality/metalk8s/

This guide describes how to set up a MetalK8s_ cluster to play with. It
offers general requirements and describes sizing, configuration, and
deployment. It also explains major concepts central to MetalK8s architecture,
and will show how to access various services after completing the setup.

With respect to installation procedures, the only significant difference
between a test cluster and a full production environment is the amount of
resources required to implement the design.
